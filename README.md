## Demo Server

- Try ["by me a coffe"](https://examples.e36.io/src/coffee.html): Demo how it is used
- Log on to:  ["cash36 Platform (Rinkeby)"](https://demo.e36.io): might be offline some at some times

## Start the server locally

```bash
yarn start
```

## Coding examples

- Use element36 to wire-transfer Euro and CHF to smart contracts
- Trigger wire transfers from smart contracts
- Reveal identity of the senders of CHF36 and EUR36

## Aragon: Wire-transfer to a 0x address

The Aragon platform supports the management of organizations and communities using Smart Contracts.
With elment36, these organizations can reach out to users without blockchain knowlegde and
use the tradional payment network e.g. for funding purposes, without loosing the 
safety and transparency of blockchain apps. See a list of Aragon Dapps [here](https://poweredby.aragon.org/).  

*Try out and test* [WALLET-FREE](https://examples.e36.io/src/index.html) transfers to Aragon. You may create own contracts or use any ERC20 contract instead. Source of the demo project is [here](./src/aragon.html).


## Ethereum: contract initiates wire-transfer

Trigger wire (bank) transfers via Smart Contract. This project contains a demo-contract deloyed on mainnet and several Testnets:  
[Ping-Contract](https://github.com/element36-io/cash36-ping)

For reaching people without an 0x address, our ERC20 offers following [function](https://github.com/element36-io/cash36-contracts/blob/e15d8b807418e90accda7f36cc03c7f9b5d4dc8b/contracts/Token36.sol#L113):  

```solidity
function transferClue(bytes32 identityClue, uint256 value)
```

Instead of an 0x-adress of a wallet you give a "clue" about the identiy. The clue is evaluated on the cash36 backend using the ethereum event log.  If the clue can be resolved to an identity, the payment will be done by either a transaction a wallet or to a bank account. As clue we currently use transaction hashes as follows:

- If a user send funds via cash36 without wallet like in aragon example above, the cash36-exchange sends CHF36/EUR36 tokens to a specific address (contract or wallet).
- This transaction hash can be used later as the identifying clue. 
- The cash36-exchange will trigger the wire (bank) transfer and burns the tokens.

Cash36 contracts are [here](https://github.com/element36-io/cash36-contracts), NPM is [here](https://github.com/element36-io/cash36-contracts/packages).


## Reveal identity of sender

If a user sends CHF36 or EUR36 to a 0x wallet, the recipient gets the right to reveal the identity (email, firstname, lastname) of the user. Remember - our ERC20 lets you transfer tokens only if wallets are registered. Example for revealing data:  

```javascript
  const data = await Kyc.revealData(username, password, clue);
```

The clue can be a transaction hash or a wallet address. Check demo source [here](https://github.com/element36-io/cash36-ping/blob/6e5922339353f391e0d350e36154bced5244483c/src/js/dapp.js#L264).

## Onboarding users via API

You can send users to cash36.io or clone our fontend  
[here](https://github.com/element36-io/cash36-frontend) to make your own. The frontend can connect to mainnet or to exsiting contracts on [several](https://github.com/element36-io/cash36-contracts/blob/master/networks.md) testnets.  

You may also use our API [here](https://github.com/element36-io/cash36-frontend/blob/master/doc/src/singlepage.md) to upload KYC data. 

So far, users need to go through _our_ KYC process if you want to use _our_ tokens. By cloning our backend you can create _your_ own Stablecoins and connect them  to _your_ own bank account. Be aware that this has legal consequences, depending in which juristiction you are in.

 Please contact ask@element36.io if you are interested in such a solution.
